# secure_chat_room

A client and server system that allows users to join into a chat room to converse with other users. The messages between the users' terminals are encrypted with symmetric key cryptography (pre-shared key). Only the users with the secret key can decrypt the messages and all others who run the client program will see garbled text (the encrypted messages)

In this program, Alice and Bob are legitimate users and Trudy is an attacker.

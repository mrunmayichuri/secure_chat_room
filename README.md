# secure_chat_room

Designed a system (client and server - using Python v2.7) that allows users to join into a chat room to converse with other users. The messages between the users' terminals are encrypted with symmetric key cryptography (pre-shared key). Only the users with the secret key can decrypt the messages and all others who run the client program will see garbled text (the encrypted messages)
